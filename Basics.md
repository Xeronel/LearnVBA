A **Variable** is a named place in memory used to store data. Every variable has a **type**

##### Declaring Variables #####
Variables are declared using the keyword **Dim**. 

Originally **Dim** stood for *Dimension* (in BASIC), and was used to define the dimensions of an array. **Dim** is now used to declare every variable and *Dimension* doesn't make much sense. It may help to you remember **Dim** as *Declare in Memory* since it is used to create a space in memory to store data.


##### Example #####
```VB
Dim VarName as Integer
```

**Dim** states that you want to create a variable.
**VarName** is the name of the variable being created. This is how you store and access data in your program.
**Integer** is the type of data that will be stored in your variable.
